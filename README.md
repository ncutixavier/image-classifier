"# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds" 
"# image-classifier"

Project Goal
Improving your programming skills using Python

In this project you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier (We will focus on building a classifier ourselves later in the program).

Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.
